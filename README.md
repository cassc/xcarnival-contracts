> The overall logic is that the hacker first generates multiple contract addresses, then goes to call the `XNFT` contract, pledges the NFT, then generates an orderld, then withdraws the NFT, multiple times this operation, then calls the `XToken` contractâ€™s `borrow()` through the previous contract address as well as the orderld In the call to `borrow()`, there is no judgment that the NFT has been withdrawn, so the hacker borrowed and then did not pay it back, then keeps repeating this operation.
